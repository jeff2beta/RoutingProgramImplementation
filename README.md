# Routing Program

## Introduction
This project involves applying the algorithms and data structures learned in the course to solve a real programming problemâ€”specifically, routing delivery trucks efficiently. The objective is to ensure all deliveries meet their constraints while keeping the total distance traveled under 140 miles. The successful implementation of this program will demonstrate skills that are crucial for technical interviews and can be showcased in a professional portfolio.

## Scenario
University Parcel Service faces challenges with their daily local deliveries (DLD) in Salt Lake City. With three trucks, two drivers, and an average of 40 packages to deliver each day, the current system fails to consistently meet delivery deadlines. Each package has unique criteria and requirements. My task is to develop a routing algorithm that ensures timely delivery of all packages, adheres to each package's specific requirements, and limits the total distance traveled by all trucks to less than 140 miles.
